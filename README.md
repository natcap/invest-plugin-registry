# InVEST plugin registry
The purpose of this repo is to keep track of InVEST plugins and make them discoverable.
To contribute a plugin, open a PR adding your plugin repo's HTTPS git URL to `plugins.txt`.
We plan to use this list to render a plugin registry web page, pulling in details such as the plugin metadata and readme.
